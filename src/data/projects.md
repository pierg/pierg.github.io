# Currently

* Enable correct-by-construction designs using contracts.
* Developing formal grammar to generate correct designs.
* Optimizing the system design at different abstraction layers. From the topology to the component selection and parameters and controller optimization.

# Previously

I have analyzed how current approaches to formal verification can provide assurances:
* to the requirement corpora itself by formalizing requirements with assume/guarantee contracts
* to the reward function used to then train the system so that the requirements do not get misinterpreted
* to the execution of the system by run-time monitoring and enforcing certain invariants
* to the coordination of the system with other external entities in a system of system scenario
* to system behaviors by automatically synthesizing a correct policy.
