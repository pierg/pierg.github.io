# Intro

I'm a **postdoctoral researcher in computer science and engineering at UC Berkeley**. I'm interested in **cyber-physical systems** (modeling, design, and analysis), **AI and machine learning** (deep and reinforcement learning), **formal methods** (model checking, run-time verification, reactive synthesis), and **software engineering**. Mainly, I like to be at the intersection of these research areas.


# Currently

I am working on the DARPA project [_Symbiotic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems_](https://www.darpa.mil/program/symbiotic-design-for-cyber-physical-systems).
Developing AI‑based approaches to enable correct‑by‑construction designs.

# Previously

* Part of the [_Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)_](https://wasp-sweden.org). Developed solutions to design and build safe Autonomous Systems.
* Worked on [_Detect and AvoID Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems DAIDALUS_](https://github.com/nasa/daidalus) at [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley).
* Worked within the [_CHI+MED_](https://www.chi-med.ac.uk/research/) research team to developed analysis tools for medical devices.
