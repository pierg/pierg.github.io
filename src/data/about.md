# Intro

I'm a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley. I received my Ph.D. from the Chalmers University of Technology in 2021. I'm broadly interested in **cyber-physical systems** (modeling, design, and analysis), **AI and machine learning** (especially reinforcement learning), **formal methods** (model checking, run-time verification, reactive synthesis), and **software engineering**. Mainly, I like to be at the intersection of these research areas.


# Currently

I am working on the DARPA project [_Symbiotic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems_](https://www.darpa.mil/program/symbiotic-design-for-cyber-physical-systems).
* Enable correct-by-construction designs using contracts.
* Developing formal grammar to generate correct designs.
* Optimizing the system design at different abstraction layers. From the topology to the component selection and parameters and controller optimization.


# Previously

I have analyzed how current approaches to formal verification can provide assurances:
* to the requirement corpora itself by formalizing requirements with assume/guarantee contracts
* to the reward function used to then train the system so that the requirements do not get misinterpreted
* to the execution of the system by run-time monitoring and enforcing certain invariants
* to the coordination of the system with other external entities in a system of system scenario
* to system behaviors by automatically synthesizing a correct policy.
