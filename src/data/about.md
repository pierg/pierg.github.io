# Intro

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in [Computer Science and Engineering at UC Berkeley](https://www.icyphy.org/people.html). My specialization is in **Software/System Engineering** where I apply **Formal Methods** and Data-Driven techniques (**ML/DL**). Furthermore, I am delving into the fascinating field of **Distributed Systems**, including blockchain, and **Zero-Knowledge Proof**. With a strong passion for hands-on software development, I have actively contributed to [several open source projects](https://pierg.github.io/projects).

# Currently

Here are my current endeavors:
- **[Biochemically-Informed Neural Networks](https://pierg.github.io/projects)**:  Led the development of a TensorFlow-based framework for neural networks, featuring *versatile and customizable architectures* and dynamic synthetic data generation rooted in *biochemical physics models*. Optimized for *high-performance computing*, the framework is particularly effective in computational physics applications, ensuring enhanced efficiency and scalability.


# Previously
Here are some of my past achievements:

- Led and actively contributing to the development of [Fact Fortress](https://pierg.github.io/fact-fortress-web/), an on-chain Zero-Knowledge Proof Framework. We recently won the first prize in its category at the [ZKP/Web3 Hackathon 2023](https://zk-hacking.org), an international competition promoted by UC Berkeley.
- Contributed to the DARPA project [Symbiotic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems](https://www.darpa.mil/program/symbiotic-design-for-cyber-physical-systems), where I employ AI and formal methods to explore innovative UAV designs.
- Contributed to the development of [PACTI](https://www.pacti.org), a specification-based system analysis and design tool.
- Contributed on developing AI-based approaches to facilitate [correct-by-construction designs of Cyber-Physical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08144).
- Contributed to the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org), working on solutions for the safe design and implementation of autonomous systems.
- Worked on [Detect and AvoID Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems (DAIDALUS)](https://github.com/nasa/daidalus) at [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley), applying formal verification techniques (using [PVS](https://pvs.csl.sri.com)) to demonstrate the safety of the collision avoidance system.
- Developed analysis tools for medical devices as part of the [_CHI+MED_](https://www.chi-med.ac.uk/research/) research team at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).
