# Intro

I'm a [postdoctoral researcher](https://www.icyphy.org/people.html) in computer science and engineering at **UC Berkeley** with a PhD in the field. My background **spans software/system engineering**, AI/ML, and formal methods, and I'm particularly interested in the intersection of these areas. I approach challenges with a rigorous, analytical approach thanks to my knowledge of **formal methods**, including contracts theory, linear temporal logic, model checking, run-time verification, and reactive synthesis. I also have demonstrated expertise in **AI and machine learning**, particularly in deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques. I take a hands-on approach to software development, and have contributed to [several open source projects](https://pierg.github.io/projects). Additionally, as a computer scientist with broad interests, I'm particularly drawn to cutting-edge areas such as **blockchain technology and zero knowledge proofs**.


# Currently

* Contributing to the DARPA project [_Symbiotic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems_](https://www.darpa.mil/program/symbiotic-design-for-cyber-physical-systems), using AI and formal methods to explore innovative UAV designs.
* Contributing to the development of [_PACTI_](https://github.com/FormalSystems/pacti), a specification‑based system analysis and design tool.
* Developing AI‑based approaches to enable [_correct‑by‑construction designs of Cyber-Physical Systems_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11908).

# Previously

* Contributed to the [_Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)_](https://wasp-sweden.org), developing solutions for the safe design and implementation of autonomous systems.
* Worked on [_Detect and AvoID Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems DAIDALUS_](https://github.com/nasa/daidalus), a project focused on detecting and avoiding alerts for unmanned systems, at [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley).
* Developed analysis tools for medical devices as part of the [_CHI+MED_](https://www.chi-med.ac.uk/research/) research team at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).
