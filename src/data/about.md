# Intro

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in [computer science and engineering at UC Berkeley](https://www.icyphy.org/people.html), specializing in **software/system engineering**, **AI/ML**, **formal methods**, and exploring the exciting world of **distributed systems**, including blockchain, and **zero-knowledge proof**. With a strong passion for hands-on software development, I have actively contributed to [several open source projects](https://pierg.github.io/projects).

# Currently

Here are my current endeavors:

- Leading and actively contributing to the development of [Fact Fortress](https://pierg.github.io/fact-fortress-web/), an on-chain Zero-Knowledge Proof Framework. We recently won the first prize in its category at the [ZKP/Web3 Hackathon 2023](https://zk-hacking.org), an international competition promoted by UC Berkeley.
- Contributing to the DARPA project [Symbiotic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems](https://www.darpa.mil/program/symbiotic-design-for-cyber-physical-systems), where I employ AI and formal methods to explore innovative UAV designs.
- Contributing to the development of [PACTI](https://www.pacti.org), a specification-based system analysis and design tool.
- Focusing on developing AI-based approaches to facilitate correct-by-construction designs of Cyber-Physical Systems.

# Previously

Here are some of my past achievements:

- Contributed to the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org), working on solutions for the safe design and implementation of autonomous systems.
- Worked on [Detect and AvoID Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems (DAIDALUS)](https://github.com/nasa/daidalus) at [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley), applying formal verification techniques (using [PVS](https://pvs.csl.sri.com)) to demonstrate the safety of the collision avoidance system.
- Developed analysis tools for medical devices as part of the [_CHI+MED_](https://www.chi-med.ac.uk/research/) research team at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).
