# Intro

I'm a postdoctoral researcher in computer science and engineering at UC Berkeley with a PhD in the field. 

My expertise includes software/system engineering, AI/ML, formal methods, and a growing interest in **blockchain** and **zero-knowledge proof**. 

I take a hands-on approach to software development and have contributed to several open-source projects.

# Currently

- Leading and actively contributing to the development of [Fact Fortress, An On-Chain Zero-Knowledge Proof Framework](https://pierg.github.io/fact-fortress-web/), which won first prize of its category at the [ZKP Hackathon 2023](https://zk-hacking.org)
- Contributing to the DARPA project [Symbiotic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems](https://www.darpa.mil/program/symbiotic-design-for-cyber-physical-systems), using AI and formal methods to explore innovative UAV designs
- Contributing to the development of [PACTI](https://www.pacti.org), a specification-based system analysis and design tool
- Developing AI-based approaches to enable correct-by-construction designs of Cyber-Physical Systems

# Previously

- Contributed to the [_Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)_](https://wasp-sweden.org), developing solutions for the safe design and implementation of autonomous systems
- Worked on [Detect and AvoID Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems DAIDALUS](https://github.com/nasa/daidalus) at NASA Langley Research Center, focused on detecting and avoiding alerts for unmanned systems
- Developed analysis tools for medical devices as part of the [_CHI+MED_](https://www.chi-med.ac.uk/research/) research team at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).
