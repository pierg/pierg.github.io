My specialization is in **Software/System Engineering** where I apply **Formal Methods** and Data-Driven techniques (**ML/DL**). Furthermore, I am delving into the fascinating field of **Distributed Systems**, including blockchain, and **Zero-Knowledge Proof**. With a strong passion for hands-on software development, I have actively contributed to [several open source projects](https://pierg.github.io/projects).\n\n# Currently\n\nHere are my current endeavors:\n\n- Leading and actively contributing to the development of [Fact Fortress](https://pierg.github.io/fact-fortress-web/), an on-chain Zero-Knowledge Proof Framework. We recently won the first prize in its category at the [ZKP/Web3 Hackathon 2023](https://zk-hacking.org), an international competition promoted by UC Berkeley.\n- Contributing to the DARPA project [Symbiotic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems](https://www.darpa.mil/program/symbiotic-design-for-cyber-physical-systems), where I employ AI and formal methods to explore innovative UAV designs.\n- Contributing to the development of [PACTI](https://www.pacti.org), a specification-based system analysis and design tool.\n- Focusing on developing AI-based approaches to facilitate correct-by-construction designs of Cyber-Physical Systems.\n\n# Previously\n\nHere are some of my past achievements:\n\n- Contributed to the [Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)](https://wasp-sweden.org), working on solutions for the safe design and implementation of autonomous systems.\n- Worked on [Detect and AvoID Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems (DAIDALUS)](https://github.com/nasa/daidalus) at [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley), applying formal verification techniques (using [PVS](https://pvs.csl.sri.com)) to demonstrate the safety of the collision avoidance system.\n- Developed analysis tools for medical devices as part of the [_CHI+MED_](https://www.chi-med.ac.uk/research/) research team at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).\n",renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1}),(0,l.jsxs)("ul",{className:"actions",children:[(0,l.jsx)("li",{children:(0,l.jsx)(r.rU,{to:"/resume",className:"button",children:"Learn More"})}),(0,l.jsx)("li",{children:(0,l.jsx)(r.rU,{to:"/projects",className:"button",children:"Projects"})})]})]})})}},6459:function(e,t,n){function o(e){if(null==e)throw new TypeError("Cannot destructure "+e)}n.d(t,{Z:function(){return o}})}}]);
