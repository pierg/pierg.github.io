My background spans **software/system engineering**, AI/ML, and formal methods, and I'm particularly interested in the intersection of these areas. I approach challenges with a rigorous, analytical approach thanks to my knowledge of **formal methods**, including contracts theory, linear temporal logic, model checking, run-time verification, and reactive synthesis. I also have demonstrated expertise in **AI and machine learning**, particularly in deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques. I take a hands-on approach to software development, and have contributed to [several open source projects](https://pierg.github.io/projects). Additionally, as a computer scientist with broad interests, I'm particularly drawn to cutting-edge areas such as **blockchain technology and zero knowledge proofs**.\n\n\n# Currently\n* Leading and actively contributing to the development of [Fact Fortress, An On-Chain Zero-Knowledge Proof Framework](https://pierg.github.io/fact-fortress-web/).\n* Contributing to the DARPA project [_Symbiotic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems_](https://www.darpa.mil/program/symbiotic-design-for-cyber-physical-systems), using AI and formal methods to explore innovative UAV designs.\n* Contributing to the development of [_PACTI_](https://www.pacti.org), a specification\u2011based system analysis and design tool.\n* Developing AI\u2011based approaches to enable [_correct\u2011by\u2011construction designs of Cyber-Physical Systems_](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11908).\n\n# Previously\n\n* Contributed to the [_Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)_](https://wasp-sweden.org), developing solutions for the safe design and implementation of autonomous systems.\n* Worked on [_Detect and AvoID Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems DAIDALUS_](https://github.com/nasa/daidalus), a project focused on detecting and avoiding alerts for unmanned systems, at [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley).\n* Developed analysis tools for medical devices as part of the [_CHI+MED_](https://www.chi-med.ac.uk/research/) research team at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk).\n\n",renderers:{Link:d},escapeHtml:!1}),(0,l.jsxs)("ul",{className:"actions",children:[(0,l.jsx)("li",{children:(0,l.jsx)(o.rU,{to:"/resume",className:"button",children:"Learn More"})}),(0,l.jsx)("li",{children:(0,l.jsx)(o.rU,{to:"/resume",className:"button",children:"Projects"})})]})]})})}},2870:function(e,t,n){function s(e){if(null==e)throw new TypeError("Cannot destructure "+e)}n.d(t,{Z:function(){return s}})}}]);
