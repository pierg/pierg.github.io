I received my Ph.D. from the Chalmers University of Technology in 2021. I'm broadly interested in **cyber-physical systems** (modeling, design, and analysis), **AI and machine learning** (especially reinforcement learning), **formal methods** (model checking, run-time verification, reactive synthesis), and **software engineering**. Mainly, I like to be at the intersection of these research areas.\n\n\n# Currently\n\nI am working on the DARPA project [_Symbiotic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems_](https://www.darpa.mil/program/symbiotic-design-for-cyber-physical-systems).\n* Enable correct-by-construction designs using contracts.\n* Developing formal grammar to generate correct designs.\n* Optimizing the system design at different abstraction layers. From the topology to the component selection and parameters and controller optimization.\n\n\n# Previously\n\nI have analyzed how current approaches to formal verification can provide assurances:\n* to the requirement corpora itself by formalizing requirements with assume/guarantee contracts\n* to the reward function used to then train the system so that the requirements do not get misinterpreted\n* to the execution of the system by run-time monitoring and enforcing certain invariants\n* to the coordination of the system with other external entities in a system of system scenario\n* to system behaviors by automatically synthesizing a correct policy.\n\n\n",renderers:{Link:l},escapeHtml:!1}),(0,c.jsx)("ul",{className:"actions",children:(0,c.jsx)("li",{children:window.location.pathname.includes("/resume")?(0,c.jsx)(s.rU,{to:"/projects",className:"button",children:"About My Projects"}):(0,c.jsx)(s.rU,{to:"/resume",className:"button",children:"Learn More"})})})]})})}}}]);
