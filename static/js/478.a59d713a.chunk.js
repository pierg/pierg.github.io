I received my Ph.D. from the Chalmers University of Technology in 2021. I'm interested in **cyber-physical systems** (modeling, design, and analysis), **AI and machine learning** (especially reinforcement learning), **formal methods** (model checking, run-time verification, reactive synthesis), and **software engineering**. Mainly, I like to be at the intersection of these research areas.\n\n\n# Currently\n\nI am working on the DARPA project [_Symbiotic Design for Cyber-Physical Systems_](https://www.darpa.mil/program/symbiotic-design-for-cyber-physical-systems).\nDeveloping AI\u2011based approaches to enable correct\u2011by\u2011construction designs.\n\n# Previously\n\n* Part of the [_Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP)_](https://wasp-sweden.org). Developed solutions to design and build safe Autonomous Systems.\n* Worked on [_Detect and AvoID Alerting Logic for Unmanned Systems DAIDALUS_](https://github.com/nasa/daidalus) at [NASA Langley Research Center](https://www.nasa.gov/langley).\n* Worked within the [_CHI+MED_](https://www.chi-med.ac.uk/research/) research team to developed analysis tools for medical devices.\n\n",renderers:{Link:l},escapeHtml:!1}),(0,c.jsxs)("ul",{className:"actions",children:[(0,c.jsx)("li",{children:(0,c.jsx)(t.rU,{to:"/resume",className:"button",children:"Learn More"})}),(0,c.jsx)("li",{children:(0,c.jsx)(t.rU,{to:"/resume",className:"button",children:"Projects"})})]})]})})}}}]);
